# SquadVehicleTimer

Android app used to track respawn times of vehicles in Squad.
Maps and layers are based on the squad wiki and may not be up to date.

The timer in brackets is the spawn delay. You can start the timer with this delay by pressing the stopwatch icon.

Pressing on the icon of the vehicle adds it to the battle report, listing the number of vehicles destroyed and their total ticket cost. It resets when changing layer.

You can use only the timers by using the button under them.
